# Project 1 AI-Aided Caches-n-Logs Monitoring-n-Wiping Demon
**License**: FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software)

## Project Overview
The Cache-n-Log Wiper is a platform-independent tool designed to monitor and manage the cache and log files on your computer. With the help of AI, it analyzes each file to determine its purpose and whether it should be wiped or deleted. This project aims to help users regain control over their computer's file system and enhance privacy.

## Features
- **Monitoring**: Tracks cache and log files within the file system.
- **AI Integration**: Analyzes files to understand their utility and whether deletion is recommended.
- **File Wiping/Deletion**: Securely wipes or deletes files based on AI recommendations and user approval.

## Installation
As a prerequisite, a Java runtime environment must already be installed on the corresponding device.

### Unix
1. Download the latest .zip artifact from this repository.
2. Unpack the archive to your desired installation directory for the TraceSentry.
3. Open a terminal and set the following environment variables:
    ```
    export TRACE_SENTRY_DIR=<absolute path to installation dir>
    export PATH=$PATH:$TRACE_SENTRY_DIR/bin
   ```
    And add these commands to your shell configuration file (probably ~/.bashrc).
4. If you want to use the inspect feature create an openapi API-KEY following these instructions: ...
after that set the generated API-KEY as environment variable as follows in a terminal:
    ```
    export TRACE_SENTRY_API_KEY=<generated API-KEY>
    ```
    And add also this command to your shell configuration file.
When you skip this part you won't have access to the inspect feature but the rest will work the same way.
5. If you want that the daemon starts every time automatically in the background when you start your system,
you can do the following in a terminal:
    ```
    crontab -e
    // Add this line to the opened file:
    @reboot $TRACE_SENTRY_DIR/bin/ts-daemon
    ```
   Then save the file.

### Windows
1. Download the latest .zip artifact from this repository.
2. Unpack the archive to your desired installation directory for the TraceSentry.
3. Open a terminal and set the following environment variables:
    ```
   setx TRACE_SENTRY_DIR <absolute path to installation dir>
   setx PATH %PATH%;%TRACE_SENTRY_DIR%/bin
   ```
4. If you want to use the inspect feature create an openapi API-KEY following these instructions: ...
after that set the generated API-KEY as environment variable as follows in a terminal:
    ```
    setx TRACE_SENTRY_API_KEY <generated API-KEY>
    ```
   When you skip this part you won't have access to the inspect feature but the rest will work the same way.
5. If you want that the daemon starts every time automatically in the background when you start your system,
you can do the following in a terminal:
   ```
   copy %TRACE_SENTRY_DIR%\bin\ts-daemon.bat "%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"
   ```
